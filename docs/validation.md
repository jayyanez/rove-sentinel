# Standalone validation record

Date: September 25, 2026. This records observed acceptance, not a guarantee that
all defects have been found.

## Windows host

Node.js 24.18.0, Git 2.55.0.windows.3, Claude Code 2.1.283 and Codex CLI 0.154.0.
Both provider CLIs were authenticated through their required subscription paths.
No provider credentials or private review transcripts are included here.

| Check | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| Extracted regression suite plus standalone tests | 392 tests passed across 23 files |
| Packed package in an isolated consumer workspace | Installed without Rove code or documents |
| Version, help, initialization and default policy | Passed from the installed archive |
| Windows scheduled watcher installation | Scheduler installed; healthy compatible heartbeat |
| Deliberately broken subtraction fixture | Claude proposed the defect; Codex confirmed P2; review failed |
| Corrected subtraction fixture | Follow-up review passed for the new head |
| Hook on the reviewed head | Accepted with no bypass |
| Different unreviewed head while watcher paused | Refused; old PASS was not reused |
| Watcher reinstall | Completed successfully |
| Watcher uninstall | Scheduler removed; generated hook removed; shared hook configuration preserved |
| Retained safety pause after stopping an in-flight GitHub CLI call | No recorded process or direct child remained; healthy watcher resumed after inspection |
| Existing-hook preservation | Covered by deterministic regression tests |
| Hosted Windows CI, Node 22 and 24 | Tests, notices and archive installation passed for final extraction head `bcd81c0` |
| Published v1.9.0 archive | Downloaded from GitHub Releases; SHA-256 matched the published checksum |
| macOS and Linux live operation | Not qualified |
| Windows logoff/logon cycle | Not exercised; scheduled task was started through Task Scheduler |

The fixture had a deliberately simple arithmetic defect. It proves the installed
provider and adjudication path ran; it is not a review-quality benchmark.
Recovery and process-tree edge cases are exercised by the regression suite;
not every OS failure was induced on a live host.

A post-merge CI run on Node 22 exposed an intermittent test failure: a 250 ms
budget could expire before the child Node process produced its first output.
The follow-up test gives startup five seconds and keeps the child alive for
30 seconds, preserving the real timeout and captured-output assertion. It does
not change runtime timeouts or rewrite the published v1.9.0 archive.

During shutdown acceptance, a GitHub CLI process exited during the termination
check and the watcher retained a safety pause. Reinstallation preserved it.
Inspection found no matching process or direct child. Stale-state recovery
correctly refused to remove the healthy replacement watcher's lock; `resume`
cleared the inspected pause. A failed termination proof is never treated as
permission to continue without investigation.

Independent review covered the complete committed extraction and a follow-up.
Two repository-identity defects were fixed with regressions that failed before
the fixes. Markdown lint passes. CI results are retained in
[the workflow history](https://github.com/jayyanez/rove-sentinel/actions/workflows/verify.yml).

Rove's consumer branch passed full verification with the external candidate,
then again after removing the embedded engine: 5,647 tests passed, one test was
skipped, and Svelte reported zero errors plus one pre-existing warning. Release
adoption and the installed watcher transition require that repository's own
review and merge. Do not infer that canonical Rove is already migrated.
